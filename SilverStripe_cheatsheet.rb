        Will loop over all children of the current page context. Helpful to create page-specific subnavigations. Most likely, you'll want to use <% loop $Menu %> for your main menus, since its independent of the page context.

                  <% end_with %>"
        ```
        Will return a page in the current path, at the level specified by the numbers.
        It is based on the current page context, looking back through its parent pages.

        ```
        "Page" will return a single page from the site tree, looking it up by URL. You can use it in the <% loop %> format. 
        Can't be called using $Page(my-page).Title.

        The current page is a child of this menu item, so the current "section".

        Determines if the item is the current page. Returns "link" or "current" strings.

    end
    entry do
      name '$LinkOrCurrent'
      notes <<-'END'
        Determines if the item is in the current section, so in the path towards the current page. Useful for menus which you only want to show a second level menu when you are on that page or a child of it. Returns "link" or "section" strings.
      END
    end
    entry do
      name '$InSection(page-url)'

        This if block will pass if we're currently on the page-url page or one of its children.
